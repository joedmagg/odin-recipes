    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Southern pulled pork BBQ that is so easy to make! I have shared this Boston butt 
        BBQ crockpot recipe with family, friends, and co-workers, and they have told me that 
        this is amongst the best BBQ they have ever eaten. I use a North Carolina-style 
        vinegar-based sauce when making this, but this is the fun part of the recipe because 
        you can use any sauce you like, and it turns out great. The pulled pork makes good 
        BBQ plates; it's good on sandwiches, too.
